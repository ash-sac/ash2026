      <h1>SAC 2026</h1>

      The ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has been a primary and
      international forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineers
      and application developers to gather, interact and present their work. The
      ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP) is the sole
      sponsor of SAC. The conference proceedings are published by ACM and are
      also available online through ACM's Digital Library.

      <h1>Scope of ASH Track</h1>

      Applied computing is becoming pivotal in healthcare systems due to the
      increasing digitized and data-driven approaches in the medical domain.
      This track explores how computational techniques, such as machine
      learning, data analytics, sensor networks, cybersecurity, cloud computing,
      and interface design, transform healthcare delivery and management. By
      addressing challenges such as data privacy, interoperability, real-time
      processing, and decision support, the track will bring together
      researchers and practitioners to discuss innovative solutions and share
      insights that can bridge the gap between computing and clinical practice.
      We aim to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and highlight the
      importance of computing in building resilient, intelligent, and accessible
      healthcare systems.
