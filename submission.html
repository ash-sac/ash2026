        Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in PDF format, according to
        the instructions contained in the main Conference web site. The review
        process is double blind. Please anonymize the paper submitted for
        review. The paper length is 8 pages, with the option to add 2 additional
        pages at extra charge, up to a maximum of 10 pages. Contributions must
        contain original unpublished work. Papers that have been concurrently
        submitted to other conferences or journals (double submissions) will be
        automatically rejected. All papers must be submitted through the main
        conference web page. Paper Acceptance: Paper registration is required,
        allowing the inclusion of the paper/poster in the conference
        proceedings. An author or a proxy attending ACM SAC MUST present the
        paper: This is a requirement for the paper/poster to be included in the
        ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show of scheduled papers and posters will
        result in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.

        Student Research Competition (SRC)
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-4">
        Graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on
        their research ideas are invited to submit abstracts of their original
        unpublished and in-progress research work in areas of experimental
        computing and application development related to SAC Tracks. The Student
        Research Competition (SRC) program is designed to provide graduate
        students the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with researcher and
        practitioners in their areas of interest. All research abstract
        submissions will be reviewed by researchers and practitioners with
        expertise in the track focus area to which they are submitted. Authors
        of selected abstracts will have the opportunity to give poster
        presentations of their work and compete for three top winning places.
        The SRC committee will evaluate and select First, Second, and Third
        place winners. The winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP
        recognition certificates during the conference banquet dinner. Authors
        of selected abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel
        Award program for support. Submission - Graduate students are invited to
        submit abstracts (minimum of two pages; maximum of four pages) of their
        original unpublished and in-progress research work following the
        instructions published at SAC web-site. The submissions must address
        research work related to a SAC track, with emphasis on the innovation
        behind the research idea, including the problem being investigated, the
        proposed approach and research methodology, and sample preliminary
        results of the work. In addition, the abstract should reflect on the
        originality of the work, innovation of the approach, and applicability
        of anticipated results to real-world problems. All SRC works must be
        submitted through the main conference web page.
