          Paper registration is required for inclusion in the conference
          proceedings. An author or a proxy must attend SAC and present the
          paper or poster. This is a requirement for publication in the ACM
          Digital Library.

            Each paper will be double-blindly reviewed by at least three
            reviewers; this is an ACM requirement as SAC is a ‚ÄúRefereed
            Conference‚Äù. Please adhere to this requirement when you prepare for
            your paper. Double-blindly means that the author of a paper does not
            know the reviewers of his/her paper and reviewers do not know the
            authors of the papers they reviewed.

            By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby

            Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged
            violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be
            investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your

            Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so
            you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM
            has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made
            a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.
            We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper
            attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name
            normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
